# K-diffusion with a TransformerEncoder (Ongoing)

## Introduction:

On this notebook, we investigate the use of transformer encoders for predicting noise added to a vector or matrix. The goal is to train a model that can effectively capture the underlying noise patterns and accurately predict the noise value for each element in the sequence.

## K-Diffusion:

Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to an image in a controlled way. Imagine starting with a clean image and progressively corrupting it with noise until it becomes unrecognizable. The model then learns to reverse this process, taking the noisy image and iteratively denoising it to recover the original clean image. During training, the model sees both the noisy and clean versions of the image and learns the transformations needed for denoising.\
In the field of machine learning, k-diffusion refers to a research paper titled "Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models" by Tero Karras et al. This paper explores ways to improve diffusion models, a type of generative model that can create new data by gradually adding noise to an image (for example, could be anything else) and then reversing the process to create a clean image. K-diffusion allows for dynamically adjusting the step size during the denoising process. This can be beneficial for complex data where different areas might require varying levels of denoising effort.

This implementation was inspired by the original K-diffusion implementation. While the original implementation uses K-diffusion on images with U-Net architectures, I apply it to vectors using a Transformer encoder as the core model.

## Key Aspects:
  - Input: A vector representing your data.
  - Positional Encoding: This injects information about the relative or absolute position of each element in the sequence, crucial for transformers that lack recurrent connections.
  - Transformer Encoder: The core component that learns the noise patterns and relationships between elements.
  - Output: Predicted noise values for each element in the original vector, with the same size as the input

## Relation to Diffusion Models:

While this project doesn't directly implement diffusion models, it shares a similar objective of understanding and manipulating noise.
Diffusion models typically add noise to data in a controlled manner, and then learn to reverse the process to recover the original data. In contrast, your project focuses on predicting the noise itself, which could be a valuable step within a diffusion model framework.
Potential Applications:

  - Denoising data: The predicted noise values can be used to remove or correct noise in your data, improving its quality.
  - Data augmentation: By predicting realistic noise, you could artificially create variations of your data for training more robust models.
  - Understanding noise characteristics: The model can provide insights into the nature and distribution of noise in your data.

## Conclusion:

The integration of K-diffusion techniques with TransformerEncoder architectures for noise prediction presents a promising approach towards addressing noise-related challenges in various domains. By leveraging this methodology, we aim to enhance data quality, facilitate model training, and gain deeper insights into the characteristics of noise within data sequences.
