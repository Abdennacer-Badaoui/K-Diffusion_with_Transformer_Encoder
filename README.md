# Transformer_Econder_for_Noise_Prediction
This project investigates the use of transformer encoders for predicting noise added to a 1-dimensional vector. The goal is to train a model that can effectively capture the underlying noise patterns and accurately predict the noise value for each element in the sequence.

## Key Aspects:
**Input**: A 1D vector representing your data. \
**Positional Encoding**: This injects information about the relative or absolute position of each element in the sequence, crucial for transformers that lack recurrent connections. \
**Transformer Encoder**: The core component that learns the noise patterns and relationships between elements. \
**Output**: Predicted noise values for each element in the original vector, with the same size as the input (1D vector) \

    

## Relation to Diffusion Models:
While this project doesn't directly implement diffusion models, it shares a similar objective of understanding and manipulating noise. \
Diffusion models typically add noise to data in a controlled manner, and then learn to reverse the process to recover the original data. In contrast, your project focuses on predicting the noise itself, which could be a valuable step within a diffusion model framework.

    

## Potential Applications:
**Denoising data**: The predicted noise values can be used to remove or correct noise in your data, improving its quality. \
**Data augmentation**: By predicting realistic noise, you could artificially create variations of your data for training more robust models. \
**Understanding noise characteristics**: The model can provide insights into the nature and distribution of noise in your data. \
